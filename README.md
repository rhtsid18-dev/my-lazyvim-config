# My Lazy Vim Config 

My config for Lazy vim which is a config distribution for Neo vim.

## Key Cheat Sheet Points : -

- To get the current info on LSP Servers, run the command `:LspInfo`

- To do search ( and replace too if you need it ), on a specific path, you can use the specter plugin which is part of Lazy Vim by default
  - You can trigger specter by this command : `<Leader>sr`.
  - Once triggered, it will open a new window where you can specify the search term and the path in which to search in.
